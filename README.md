# Ygopro-Decks
This repository contains contains decks and engines that i have built to be used in Ygopro Percy. Notice that most of them are not the optimal builds, being only what I wanted to use.

--Assorted: contains anime decks, decks for tag duels, speed duel and/or bad deck I had the ideia to create.
--Backup of Percy 1.033D AI decks: contains AI decks available in that version, some AI decks that I tried to script or AI decks i found on Github.
--Engines: contains the core of some commonly used engines. You can build a deck starting from one of those.
--MR3 Decks: contains decks that I built while Master Rules 3 was a thing.
--MR4 Decks: contains decks I built for the New Master Rules.

You can submit decks via pull request and i'll merge them if you at least follow my pattern while naming the files.
